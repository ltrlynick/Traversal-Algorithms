# âœ¨Traversal Algorithmsâœ¨
### ðŸŒ± All of the Traversal Algorithms that I wrote are simple console programs implemented in C++. 
They are meant to be fast and easy to understand. They were written by me in my third semester of University.
## â˜˜ The repository contains two header files:
1) Graph Header File
2) Grid Header File
## ðŸŒµ And the Implementation of all the class methods are in the following files:
1) Graph Class Method Implementation
2) Grid Class Method Implementation
## ðŸ“ƒ The repository contains following algorithms: 
- Iterative DFS
- Recursive DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra's Algorithm on a Graph
- Dijkstra's Algorithm Pathfinding on a Grid.
